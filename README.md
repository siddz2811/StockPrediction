# StockPrediction
2.Stock Market Price Prediction Model using NLP and Machine Learning

1.This system combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) with machine learning models to forecast stock market movements by analyzing numerical price data (historical stock prices, indicators) along with textual financial data (news, tweets, earnings reports).

2.Built a hybrid model that combines LSTM-based time series forecasting with FinBERT-powered sentiment analysis of financial news and social media. Improved prediction accuracy of stock price trends by integrating both technical indicators and market sentiment.

3.Combines quantitative (price data) and qualitative (news sentiment) features
